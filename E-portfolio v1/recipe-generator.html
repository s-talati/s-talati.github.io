                    People are often looking for ways to eat food that is cheap yet healthy. 
                    Buying healthy food outside is usually very expensive and cheap foods are 
                    usually not healthy and include junk food. The cheapest way to eat healthy 
                    is to cook at home with your own groceries. Young people like students or 
                    bachelors living alone can have a hard time eating proper meals due to busy 
                    lifestyles and budget problems. Busy lifestyles can lead to people not being 
                    able to go grocery shopping very often and budget problems can lead to people 
                    buying limited number of groceries and limited variety of groceries. Furthermore, 
                    even with groceries at home, not a lot of youngsters know how to cook proper 
                    meals and often resort to low effort microwavable packet meals.

                    These include providing a variety of recipes and providing healthy recipes that 
                    constitute as a proper meal. It should be a reliable source for young people to 
                    be able to make their own meals. The effectiveness of the product can be measured 
                    by the number of users / newly acquired users, and the ratio of people making 
                    their meals at home vs buying food outside.

                <p class="prj-para">
                    My main sources for doing secondary research were news articles and websites. The snippets below were 
                    used to verify or falsify my assumptions.
                </p> <br>
                <p class="callout-2">
                    A survey at Temple University and Wisconsin HOPE Lab showed that more than a third of students struggle 
                    with food habits and that 36% of college students do not have enough to eat. A reason for this is that 
                    more low-income students are going to colleges now and this has contributed to the increase in food 
                    insecurities amongst students. 
                </p>
                <p class="prj-para">
                    This verifies my assumption that college students do have poor food habits and have a low budget for 
                    food amongst many other things. This survey was only done in one university in USA and cannot necessarily 
                    be applied to all students across the globe especially since USA in general has differing food habits than 
                    other countries including Canada. Therefore, more research was needed in this category to verify this assumption. 
                </p> <br>
                <p class="callout-2">
                    A study by Sam Abraham et.al found that college students tended to select food according to convenience, 
                    taste, time, and price, rather than nutritional values. First year students tend to gain weight due to 
                    changes in physical environments which include dietary intake and change in food habits. Men and women 
                    faced different barriers. While men's barriers were limited access to healthier foods and large work 
                    overload, women reported lack of time to eat healthy and stress.
                </p>
                <p class="prj-para">
                    This shows certain characteristics of students such as being busy with school workload and stress and 
                    not having time which can infer that they do not have time to go grocery shopping on a regular basis. 
                    They are also less exposed to healthier foods and likely more exposed to fast-food places. 
                    This change of environment from being dependent on parents in high school to being independent in 
                    college affects them physically and mentally. This study also confirms students needs and desires 
                    which include prioritizing convenience, taste, time, and price, and that they usually are not able 
                    to prioritize nutritional value and health as much as they would like to. Along with my previous resource, 
                    this also confirms that students tend to have poor food habits.

                <p class="prj-para">
                    Using Food Service Director, I was able to find the following statistics on college students food habits and purchases. </p> <br>
                    <ul class="prj-para">
                        <li class="prj-bullets">25% students follow a type of diet (vegetarian, vegan, etc)</li>
                        <li class="prj-bullets">60% students say they are more likely to purchase late night snacks off campus</li>
                        <li class="prj-bullets">18% students say they are more likely to purchase late night snacks on campus </li>
                        <li class="prj-bullets">47% students agree they visit off campus restaurants more often on the weekend than the weekdays </li>
                        <li class="prj-bullets">17% students who live off campus participate in a meal plan </li>
                    </ul> <br>
                <p class="prj-para">
                    The above statistics show many students tend to purchase food off campus at restaurants and convenience 
                    stores whether it is for lunch / dinner or late-night snacks. Not many students participate in a meal 
                    plan which would actually be better than buying outside food since it would be healthier and provide 
                    more nutrition value. There are also a considerable number of students who follow a dietary restriction 
                    such as not eating meat and these meals are more expensive when bought outside than meat-based food from 
                    fast food restaurants. Therefore, for these users, buying ingredients and making food themselves is more 
                    cost effective than prepared foods.

                    An article by Forbes shows how much money can be saved by cooking at home and why it is something bachelors 
                    prefer. Not only can you use healthier ingredients, but you can also set portions to a reasonable size. 
                    An analysis was done on recipe data to find the true cost of making a meal from scratch compared to a 
                    restaurant delivery or meal kit. Data was analyzed from 'wellio', an ingredients price breakdown platform. 
                    They looked at the average cost per serving of cook from scratch to the cost of a serving from a restaurant 
                    or meal kit delivery service. Results showed on average it is five times more expensive to order delivery 
                    than to cook at home and meal kits are three times more expensive.
                </p> <br>
                <p class="prj-para">
                    This article looked at cost and not time. This is something that bachelors care about since they are more 
                    affected by the costs than the time it takes. Especially for lower income individuals who want to cook to 
                    save money but simply do not know how. By selecting affordable ingredients of their choice when going 
                    grocery shopping, they can find a variety of recipes by using this product and save costs up to five times. 
                    This is useful because they can save portions and take it to work the next day too.

                    The first graph above shows smartphone usage by age demographics. My assumption was that students under 
                    the age of 24 would be more tech savvy than young bachelors over the age of 24. However, the difference 
                    between the two groups is only 1% and this confirms that both groups are equally tech savvy. The second 
                    graph above shows the usage penetration of food and cooking apps among age and gender demographics. 
                    Females are more likely to use cooking apps than males. However, my assumption that more people under 
                    the age of 30 would use this product was wrong since people from 35-49 use apps like these just as much.
