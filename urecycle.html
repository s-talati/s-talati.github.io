            <div class="prj-content">
                
                <p class="prj-para">In 2019 alone, the University of Waterloo (UW) sent approximately 
                    3,028 tonnes of waste to landfills, which equates to a waste 
                    diversion rate of just 33.2%. When compared to other institutions, 
                    this rate is relatively abysmal. For example, the University of 
                    British Columbia is on track to achieve an 80% waste diversion rate 
                    in 2020, despite having nearly 10,000 more students at their Vancouver 
                    campus than UW. The Office of Sustainability developed a Zero Waste Action 
                    Plan in 2017, with the goal of achieving a 90% diversion rate on campus by 2035. 
                    The efforts on this front are primarily infrastructure based, such as implementing 
                    a receptacle standard for recyclables and organics. These changes are a great start, 
                    however, they fail to acknowledge issues with human behaviour that lead to the 
                    generation of such large amounts of waste.</p>

                <p class="prj-para">The objective of this project is to tackle the problem of waste 
                    diversion by changing human behaviour with respect to recycling. Through the use 
                    of existing technologies, such as object detection and web mapping services, uncertainty 
                    can be removed from the recycling process. Furthermore, by making use of a customer 
                    loyalty program, and rewarding those that make sustainable decisions on campus, 
                    people will be more likely to abstain from their convenience based behaviours and 
                    deconstruct their pre-existing biases towards recycling programs. This was a fourth year 
                    design project by my team and I.</p>

                <p class="prj-para">To better grasp the relationship target users currently have with recycling 
                    on campus, a user questionnaire was created with the goal of understanding user motivations 
                    as well as user knowledge of recycling practices. The survey consisted of 15 questions in which 
                    10 questions focused on gathering information about current user behavior and motivation, 
                    3 questions tested user knowledge of how to correctly dispose items, and 2 questions asked about 
                    user demographics. Questions were formulated using previous problem space research and researching 
                    existing university/college recycling survey questions to ensure unbiased phrasing, particularly a 
                    study done by students at the University of Northern Iowa. The survey was created and distributed 
                    using Google Forms and was sent to current university students and alumni.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="callout">The top two reasons for 68.3% of users for not recycling was a lack of knowledge 
                    as to what can and cannot be recycled, as well as the inconvenience in finding a nearby recycling bin location.</p>
                <p class="prj-para">In terms of user attitudes and behaviours towards recycling, it was found that the 
                    majority of users try to recycle as much as possible or at least when convenient. One aspect from the 
                    results that stood out was that only 6% of respondents said they always sorted multi-material items like 
                    coffee cups before recycling, which indicated that sorting items is not a typical user behaviour. However, 
                    the results revealed that users do highly value sustainability, with 86% of users being highly concerned 
                    for the environment. When asked to rank their reasons for recycling from most important to least important, 
                    social responsibility and conserving resources were the two most important reasons for 100% of 
                    respondents. Making money through incentivization was also selected by a significant number of users, 
                    which implies that rewards would encourage users to behave sustainably. The top two reasons for 68.3% of 
                    users for not recycling was a lack of knowledge as to what can and cannot be recycled, as well as the 
                    inconvenience in finding a nearby recycling bin location. The lack of knowledge users had around recycling 
                    was reinforced by the questions that tested user knowledge, which if asked a fountain drink cup, 
                    plastic straw, and coffee cup would be recycled. 74% of users incorrectly sorted the fountain drink, 
                    46% of users incorrectly sorted the plastic straw, and 48% of users discarded the coffee cup incorrectly. </p>

                <p class="callout">The 3 usability goals defined for our product were the following: effective to use, easy to learn, and easy to remember how to use.</p>
                <p class="prj-para">Effectiveness, as it pertains to usability, will be measured by the time it takes for a user to complete defined tasks, as well as the number of users who return to the app after initial use. The second usability goal can be measured by the user's error rate while learning the app, that is, the number of errors made for each task performed within the app. The app also needs to be easy to remember how to use so that users return to the app and already know what to do, making it faster for them to complete the task. This will be measured by the error rate when a user repeats a previously learned task.</p>
                <p class="prj-para">The protocol for establishing UX goals involved using the Microsoft Desirability Toolkit, which is a tool designed to measure one's attitudes toward a user interface by using a list of positive and negative reaction words. We made lists of both desirable and undesirable reactions to obtain from users testing the product. The top three positive words we wanted to hear from users were: simple, supportive, and motivated. The top three negative reactions we wanted to avoid hearing from users were: complicated, obstructive, and uninterested.</p>

                <p class="prj-para">
                    The next step was to start brainstorming and designing solutions. 
                    In order to generate many potential solutions while ensuring that 
                    each group member can contribute to the design, the team opted to 
                    make use of the Sprint method. A remote whiteboarding platform called 
                    Mural was used in order to conduct this process remotely. Once sketches 
                    by each individual in the team were completed, each of them were 
                    critiqued and voted on by the individual team members. The components 
                    of each sketch that received votes, and were feasible to combine, were 
                    developed into a low-fidelity prototype the following day. The team 
                    ultimately chose to create a mockup of a mobile app with an accompanying tablet app.

                <p class="prj-para">
                    On our homepage, we wanted to give users the option of either using the camera
                    to scan the item, the sorting list from UW's website, or the search bar, to 
                    determine where their waste should go.

                <p class="prj-para">
                    Incentivization was an important component we wanted to include in our app 
                    to encourage users to actually use the recycling app. To ensure people act 
                    in good faith, we decided to design the prototype to interact with a camera 
                    sensor on the bins and have users show a QR code generated from the app to 
                    said sensor to earn points.

                <p class="prj-para">
                    Onboarding screens explaining the main functionality of our solution were

                <p class="prj-para">
                    After learning that users generally have a gap in knowledge when it comes to 
                    sustainability on campus, it was important that users were shown important information 
                    on the home screen of the application. Users also mentioned that their own recycling 
                    habits are typically driven by a care for the environment and social responsibility. 
                    This resulted in the addition of a "Did You Know?" card, which shows users a fun fact 
                    or piece of information regarding the University of Waterloo's sustainability goals and 
                    general information related to global warming and climate change. 
                </p> <br>
                <p class="prj-para">
                    Implementing a feature that informs the user of the nearest recycle bin and perhaps navigating 
                    them to it was an important component in our solution. This would be most beneficial 
                    for first year students who are unfamiliar with the campus and for bins located outside the buildings.

                    We created user flows for the following journeys a user can take when using our intended solution as shown below.
                    Depicting these flows allowed us to evaluate and optimize overall layout and navigation. It was
                    an essential step in deciding the major screens of the app.

                    Moodboards guided our color palette, iconography, and overall personality of the final solution.
                    Our goal was to figure out the moods and emotions we want to evoke for users to provide a better user experience.
                    We found inspiring images, colours, graphics and words and created the mood board in Adobe Spark.
                    The mood board also helped us align as a team on the visual aspects of our design.
                    These colors represent the themes of sustainability, nature, and vegetation.

                <p class="prj-para">
                    The final design solution consists of a mobile app and tablet app that work in conjunction to allow users to recycle items and redeem points
                    using a shared database. The iPhone prototype consists of the following screens that showcase classification, search functionality, 
                    and location information. When logging in, users are navigated to the home screen where they can use the sorting guide to search 
                    through waste categories, and three buttons for classification, navigation, and rewards. The classification aspect has two components 
                    for beta testing purposes - classify images from a directory of manually added images and images captured through the iPhone camera. 
                    Once the image has been pulled and reformatted according to the specifications, a classification label is outputted to the screen to 
                    notify the user.

                <p class="prj-para">
                    The tablet app is web-based and was built using React.js.
                    A web application was built since web-apps can be deployed to any device with 
                    internet connection, meaning the application is not restricted to particular devices 
                    or operating systems. The web-app is intended to be deployed to a tablet with a 
                    front-facing camera and touch-screen functionality and placed on kiosk stands next 
                    to multi-stream waste receptacles. The web-app has three primary features: the recycling 
                    sorting guide, the item scanner, and the QR code scanner. The “Map” page shows users a 
                    map of the entire campus, and currently includes labelled indoor maps for the E5, E7, and DC 
                    buildings. The tablet app not only serves as an alternative to those without a mobile device, 
                    but is also essential for mobile users to redeem points. The QR scanner scans the QR code on the 
                    mobile showed by the user.

                <p class="prj-para">
                    User testing sessions consisted of four different scenarios, 
                    involving the major functions of both the mobile and tablet 
                    interfaces, with one scenario involving the interaction between 
                    the two. Users were asked to use the think-aloud technique. Upon 
                    test completion, a debrief session was conducted where participants 
                    were quizzed on the details of completed tasks. These post-interviews 
                    provided a way to assess the system’s ease of learning. For example, 
                    one of the tasks involved the participant showing a QR code generated 
                    within the mobile application to the camera on the tablet interface near 
                    the bins, which would result in points being added to their account. 
                    We then asked 
                    participants to describe how the point collection process works. Users also 
                    completed a post-questionnaire that consisted of 26 questions, each asking 
                    the user to indicate on a scale from -3 to +3 how they felt about the 
                    prototype with respect to a pair of words shown at either end of the scale 
                    that were categorized into one of six different scales: attractiveness, 
                    perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty. 
                    Following the pattern from the previous usability study, the User 
                    Experience Questionnaire Handbook was utilized to set benchmarks for 
                    usability and user experience goals. The benchmarks are based on data 
                    collected from 20190 users across 452 different studies. The goal for 
                    the study was to achieve results in the 90th percentile for attractiveness, 
                    perspicuity, and efficiency, and to be in the 80th percentile for dependability, 
                    stimulation, and novelty.

                <p class="callout">Results</p> 
                <p class="prj-para">
                    A total of 8 users were recruited for this round of testing. Usability goals established 
                    for this system were that it should be effective, easy to use, and easy to remember how 
                    to use. Completion rate was used to measure effectiveness, by assigning a value of ‘1’ 
                    if the participant was able to complete a task and a value of ‘0’ if not. While a 
                    completion rate of 100% is ideal, according to a study by Jeff Sauro, the average task 
                    completion rate is 78% which is based on an analysis of 1100 tasks. All participants 
                    were able to complete all the tasks giving a task completion rate of 100% which is above 
                    the benchmark of 78%. Error rate was used as a metric to measure ease of use by 
                    assigning a value of ‘0’ if the participant made no errors in the task and a value 
                    of ‘1’ if one error was made. Error rates for all tasks 
                    were low ranging from 0 to 0.25; the second task had an error rate of 0, meaning users had no issues switching 
                    from the mobile to the tablet. According to Sauro’s study, the average number of errors per 
                    task is 0.7 based on an analysis of 719 tasks. Error rates for all the tasks in this study 
                    exceed the benchmark of 0.7 with the highest error rate being only 0.25. It is important to 
                    note that these rates can vary depending on the task, since not all tasks are equally easy or difficult.
